In task 2 for web scrapping first I tried with only beautiful soup package for python and tried to retrieve the data by inspect on the web link but that was not 
successful as the ycombinator is a dynamic website and it keeps loading the companies and we have to include scroll down feature for scraping all the companies and 
therefore I used Selenium for dynamic web as it is a web browser automation tool. 

Requirements for running this code:
#setting the query string to top100 to false makes the site load all companies in 1 list

selenium package — used to automate web browser interaction from Python. 

Virtualenv — to create an isolated Python environment for our project.

ChromeDriver — provides a platform to launch and perform tasks in specified browser.
chrome driver is based on chrome 83, and needs local chrome 83 installation, 
more drivers can be found here https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
driver is expected in the script path

The total no of companies count is 1000 and I scraped the company name, URL. This is working well for all 1000 companies.


Optimization possible
I have also tried to encode the company information under ‘facts’ tag that is ‘founded’, ‘team size’ and ‘location’ for the1000 companies 
and its also working fine but due to one italic letter “I” in one one of the company “kudzo” .
I have to make some Unicode or utf change while writing into csv but its printing fine for first 100 companies.Even for 1000 companies but not writing in correct
format for 1000 ones and I am working on that now and will notify you once its update for now I tried with Unicode escape but its not writing in correct 
format so I will fix this soon.
